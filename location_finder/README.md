# LocationFinder client for QGIS

## Purpose

This plugin adds a dock widget to QGIS that allows using
a LocationFinder instance for interactive geocoding:
search for place names and zoom or pan the map accordingly.

## Usage

This plugin is meant for organizations that use LocationFinder
for geocoding based on their own location data, such as address
points and/or arbitrary points of interests. For more information,
please see <https://dirageosystems.ch/lf.en.html>

If you are looking for geocoding against global address data,
try another plugin that uses data from OpenStreetMap or Google
or other sources with global coverage, search "geocoding" on
<https://plugins.qgis.org/> to find other plugins.
